Opencv DNN Support on windows
=============================
- This repository contains the steps to build OpenCV with DNN support on Windows.
- The steps are tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019.

# Steps
1. Install CMake
    - Download and install CMake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/) to build OpenCV with cuda and cudnn support.
    - Add CMake to the system path.
2. Install Visual Studio
    - Download and install Visual Studio 2019 from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
3. Install CUDA Toolkit
    - Download and install CUDA Toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).
    - Add CUDA Toolkit to the system path.
4. Install cuDNN
    - Download and install cuDNN from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
    - Add cuDNN to the system path.
5. Innstall anaconda
    Although this is not an important step, itâ€™s recommended for smooth installation.
    You need to uninstall previous installations of Python and Anaconda.
    Reinstall Anaconda from here.
    - Download and install anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
    Install NumPy from the terminal using pip install numpy.
6. clone opencv and opencv_contrib
    - clone opencv from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git)
    - clone opencv_contrib from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
    git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
    ```
7. Run Cmake GUI
    - In Where is the source code, Select the main opencv extracted folder.
    - In Where to build the binaries, Select the empty build folder we created above.
